# Awesome Artificial Intelligence (AI) Research [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)

Artificial Intelligence (AI) has become a vast research area, with tens of thousands of papers published every year. It's more and more difficult to track a specific topic among many top conferences and journals. This list aims to maintain a meta list of up-to-date research paper lists to help researchers get familiar with cutting edge research in a specific area, and (hopefully) provide a large scale picture of the trending of AI research.

Please consider contributing to this list by opening an issue with the recommended awesome paper list.

The included lists should: 

1. Cover influential papers in a specific area.
2. Cover up-to-date publications from top converences and journals such as NeurIPS, ICML, TPAMI, etc.
3. Recommend some good tutorial or survey if possible (optional).
